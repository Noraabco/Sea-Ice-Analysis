“Blue Ocean Event” (BOE) is a colloqial name for the event where there
is no sea ice in the northern hemisphere. If the current trends continue,
we are expected to see the first BOE around 2050 or so. In this analysis, I will
predict when will the average sea ice extent go to zero. We will be looking
at two months: September and March. Northern sea ice reaches its yearly
minimum in September and maximum in March.
The dataset ice-extent.csv can be downloaded from NSIDC webpage 

The main variables are:

- **year** 1978-2022
- **mo** month, 1-12
- **data-type** data source (satellite)
- **region** “N” for northern, “S” for southern hemisphere
- **extent** in M km2. Extent is the sea area that is covered by ice by at least 15%.
- **area** in M km2. Sea ice area. Area is considered a less reliable figure than extent because of measurement issues—satellites have hard time
distinguishing between open water, and water on ice
